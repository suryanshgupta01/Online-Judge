## Introduction
Hi, I'm Suryansh Gupta, a final year BTech graduate from NSUT Delhi with a special interest in software development and core website functionalities.

## Project Overview
This project is an Online Judge platform where users can submit code in 6 different languages and receive real-time feedback on their submissions. It supports features such as handling time limit exceeded errors, wrong answers, compilation issues, and segmentation faults.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports login via email/password, Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and Twitter IDs.
- **Problem Set**: Provides a collection of problems with titles, statements, and input/output formats.
- **Code Execution**: Executes user-submitted code in Python, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, or Java.
- **Contests**: Hosts timed coding contests with automatic scoring, ranking, and leaderboard updates.
- **Admin Functionality**: Allows admins to manage problems, create contests, and set problem details and durations.
- **Backend Security**: Implements Docker for code isolation and virtualization to ensure security and prevent malicious user activities, with IP rate limiting for additional safety.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Built using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for frontend and backend development.
- **Deployment**: Utilizes Docker containers for scalability, security, and easy deployment across different environments.

## Future Enhancement
- Include real-time chat support for contestants.
